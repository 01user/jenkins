<div>
    Specify where Jenkins should store workspaces for builds that are executed
    on the master.<br>
    It has no effect on builds that are executed on agents.
    <p>
    This value can include the following variables:
    <ul>
        <li><tt>${JENKINS_HOME}</tt> &mdash; The Jenkins home directory
        <li><tt>${ITEM_ROOTDIR}</tt> &mdash; The directory where Jenkins stores config data for a given job
        <li><tt>${ITEM_FULL_NAME}</tt> &mdash; The full name of a given job,
            which may be slash-separated, e.g. <tt>foo/bar</tt> for the job
            <tt>bar</tt> in folder <tt>foo</tt>
    </ul>
    The value should normally include <tt>${ITEM_ROOTDIR}</tt> or
    <tt>${ITEM_FULL_NAME}</tt>, otherwise different jobs will end up sharing the
    same workspace.
    <p>
    As builds tend to be disk I/O intensive, changing this value enables you to
    put build workspaces on faster storage hardware, such as SSDs or even RAM
    disks.
    <p>
    The default value is <tt>${ITEM_ROOTDIR}/workspace</tt>.
</div>
