<div>
    Specify where Jenkins should store build records. This includes the console
    output and other metadata generated by a build.
    <p>
    This value can include the following variables:
    <ul>
        <li><tt>${JENKINS_HOME}</tt> &mdash; The Jenkins home directory
        <li><tt>${ITEM_ROOTDIR}</tt> &mdash; The directory where Jenkins stores config data for a given job
        <li><tt>${ITEM_FULL_NAME}</tt> &mdash; The full name of a given job,
            which may be slash-separated, e.g. <tt>foo/bar</tt> for the job
            <tt>bar</tt> in folder <tt>foo</tt>
    </ul>
    The value must include <tt>${ITEM_ROOTDIR}</tt> or
    <tt>${ITEM_FULL_NAME}</tt>, so that each job can store its build records
    separately.
    <p>
    Changing this value allows you to store build records on a larger, but
    slower disk, rather than on the same disk where builds are executed.
    <p>
    The default value is <tt>${ITEM_ROOTDIR}/builds</tt>.
</div>
