# GENERATED FILE. DO NOT MODIFY.
#
# This file is for the Jenkins core developers to place what we think is the best filtering rules
# that balance the unnecessary exposure of data to slaves vs backward compatibility with plugins
#
# To override these rules, place *.conf files by other names into this folder. Files are sorted
# before parsed, so using a lower number allows you to override what we have here. This file
# gets overwritten every time Jenkins starts.
#
# see http://jenkins-ci.org/security-144 for more details

# This directory contains credentials, master encryption keys, and other sensitive information
# that slave have absolutely no business with.
# Unless there are rules in other files allowing access to other portions of $JENKINS_HOME,
# this rule as it stands here has no effect, because anything left unspecified is rejected.
deny all <JENKINS_HOME>/secrets/.*

# User content is publicly readable, so quite safe for slaves to read, too
# xunit plugin is known to read from here
# https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/User+Content
allow read,stat <JENKINS_HOME>/userContent/.*

# In next rule we grant lots of access under builds directory, so first protect ones that we
# think are somewhat more sensitive. We found no plugins that hit those rules either
deny all <BUILDDIR>/build.xml

# Various plugins read/write under builds, so allow them all
# - Git 1.x and Subversion plugin writes changelog
# - analysis-core and its families write reports
# - cobertura plugin and violation plugin writes reports from slaves
allow all <BUILDDIR>/.+

# all the other accesses that aren't specified here will be left upto other rules in this directory.
# if no rules in those other files matches, then the access will be rejected.
