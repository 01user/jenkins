# GENERATED FILE. DO NOT MODIFY.
#
# This file is for the Jenkins core developers to place what we think is the best filtering rules
# that balance the unnecessary exposure of data to slaves vs backward compatibility with plugins
#
# These rules are perfectly secure when you, the administrator of Jenkins, controls all the slaves
# and you have not accepted less-trusted slaves from somebody else.
#
# To override these rules, place *.conf files by other names into this folder. Files are sorted
# before parsed, so using a lower number allows you to override what we have here.
#
# see http://jenkins-ci.org/security-144 for more details

# This directory contains credentials, master encryption keys, and other sensitive information
# that slave have absolutely no business with
deny all <JENKINS_HOME>/secrets/.*

# User content is publicly readable, so quite safe for slaves to read, too
# xunit plugin is known to read from here
# https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/User+Content
allow read,stat <JENKINS_HOME>/userContent/.*

# In next rule we grant lots of access under builds directory, so first protect ones that we
# think are somewhat more sensitive. We found no plugins that hit those rules either
deny all <BUILDDIR>/build.xml

# Various plugins read/write under builds, so allow them all
# - Git 1.x and Subversion plugin writes changelog
# - analysis-core and its families write reports
# - cobertura plugin and violation plugin writes reports from slaves
allow all <BUILDDIR>/.+
