    With this option checked, Jenkins will not do a checkout from the SCM system 
    for each configuration. It only checks out once as the parent of the matrix project.
    This can be useful if your configuration can build concurrent from the same 
    master source (e.g. via network share or when all builds run on the same node), 
    and it saves the time, bandwidth and disk space of the SCM-checkout.
    
    <p>
    This feature is often used in conjunction with the custom workspace so that you
    have a known fixed location of the workspace.
