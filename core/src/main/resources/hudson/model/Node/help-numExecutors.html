  This controls the number of concurrent builds that Jenkins may perform on the
  master agent. So the value affects the overall system load Jenkins may incur.
  A good value to start with would be the number of CPU cores on the machine.
  <p>
  Increasing this value beyond that would cause each build to take longer, but
  it could increase the overall throughput. For example, one build may be
  CPU-bound, and in the meantime another build, which is I/O-bound, can take
  advantage of the spare I/O capacity at that moment.
  <p>
  Setting this value to 0 will prevent the master from executing any builds.
