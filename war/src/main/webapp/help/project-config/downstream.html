<div>
  Trigger builds of the other projects once a build is successfully completed.
  Multiple projects can be specified by using comma, like "abc, def".

  <p>
  Other than the obvious use case where you'd like to build other projects that have a dependency
  on the current project, this can also be useful to split a long build process in to multiple
  stages (such as the build portion and the test portion).
  <p>
    When using
    <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/CloudBees+Folders+Plugin">CloudBees Folder Plugin</a>
    or other plugins depending on it and organizing jobs into folders such as
    <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Multi-Branch+Project+Plugin">Multi-Branch Project Plugin</a>,
    projects located inside folders can be specified using an absolute path starting with "/" or a
    relative path from the current project location.
